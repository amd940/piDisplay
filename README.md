# piDisplay
2 Digit, 7 Segment LED Display Controller Software for the Raspberry Pi. A module for Node.js.

This is a very early alpha version of piDisplay. This module can display numbers and some letters on a 7 segment, 2 digit LED display that is connected to a Raspberry Pi. It runs via node.js. I don't have time to go into detail about how all this works at the moment, so you'll have to look through the code if you're curious about using this module. I will try to update this repository soon. Thanks for your patience.
